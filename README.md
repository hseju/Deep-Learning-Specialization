## Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI

Hello All,

After having learned all aspects and fundamentals of traditional machine learning and Data Science, I wanted to further my knowledge into Deep Learning. 

So Here I am taking this courser by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) (Andrew Ng). 

I will be keeping track of my progress in this course in this repository and will post my learning through lecture notes as well as projects. 

Alternatively, milestone projects are posted in separate repository as well according to their names. 

Certificate will be available in this repository once achieved.
